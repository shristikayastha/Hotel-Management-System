In the dynamic and ever-evolving hospitality sector, the challenges faced by hoteliers in managing reservations, room allocations, and other essential tasks really needs a scalable system.
So, the “HOTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM” is a project which implements the feature of data structure, notably "SINGLY LINKED LIST", seeks to the handling of visitor bookings, room allocations, and other essential functions within a hotel setting. Here, each node is represented with a room and data property of a node holds the information like date of booking, guest’s name, ID of room and type of room.
This system basically includes the following functions:
1.	Allocate room
2.	Search room
3.	Update room
4.	Delete room
5.	Show room records
6.	Sort room number
